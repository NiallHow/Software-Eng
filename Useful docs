Start of Blog (16.11.2016)
We have decided to work on the project Myhome which is a Home finance management project. It is a simple desktop program
that runs in Microsoft Visual Studio. At first glance the main features and bug fixes we are going to implement are of medium
and low priorty, however we feel like we should achieve smaller goals fist and see what its like doing a full SCRUM rotation. 
The fixes we are going to do are:

Updating categories allows the id to be changed #98
The code should be updated to follow the following steps:
Try to pull the item from the database
If the item does not exist do nothing or create a new item (this can be decided during the work)
Update only the updatable properties
save the item

&

Deleting a Transaction #74 - 

&

Category Decription Field #71 - The category object should have an additional field to contain comments/description.
